# Build-a-Deep-Learning-Based-Image-Classifier-with-R
Course Objectives

In this course, we are going to focus on two learning objectives:

    Solve a basic image classification problem with neural networks
    Use the Keras Interface to R to build a neural network

By the end of this course, you will have used the R programming language to build, train, and evaluate a neural network model to classify images of clothing items into categories such as t-shirts, trousers, and sneakers.
Course Structure

This course is divided into 3 parts:

    Course Overview: This introductory reading material.
    Build a Deep Learning Based Image Classifier with R: This is the hands on project that we will work on in Rhyme.
    Graded Quiz: This is the final assignment that you need to pass in order to finish the course successfully.

Project Structure

The hands on project on Build a Deep Learning Based Image Classifier with R is divided into following tasks:
Task 1: Project Overview and Import Libraries
Task 2: Import the Fashion MNIST Dataset
Task 3: Data Exploration
Task 4: Preprocess the Data
Task 5: Build the Model
Task 6: Compile the Model
Task 7: Train and Evaluate the Model
